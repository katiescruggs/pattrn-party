# Pattrn Party

##Pattrn Party was my first time creating a pattern library of reusable elements for future projects. You can visit the three elements live [here](http://katiescruggs.com/pattrn-party).

## Three responsive design patterns:

### Accordion Tabs
This module has four tabs that correspond with different content. Clicking on a tab changes the content. There is a wide desktop version, and then a tablet and mobile version where the tabs collapse into columns for a better experience on small screens.

### Flexible Cards
This element contains flexible cards. These cards have one of two classes that determine whether they are large or small (and it would be easy to add additional widths). On small screens, the cards all become one width and stack into a column.

### Header Bar
This is a header bar with an image, three navigation links, and a search bar. When the browser width gets small, the navigation links and search bar are replaced with the word "MENU", which designates to the user that the header is clickable. When the user clicks the header on a small screen, the navigation options and search bar appear below the bar.
